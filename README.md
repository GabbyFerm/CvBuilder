# CvBuilder - Resume builder project in C#
This project is a simple resume builder application that allows users to create, view, edit, and delete resumes. Users can also register, log in, and export resumes to PDF. The application is built with C# and uses SQL for database management to store user data and resumes.
This project is currently under development. I plan to complete the remaining features and styling during the Web Applications course.

## Features (Implemented so far)
- User registration and login functionality
- Create, edit, view, and delete resumes
- Export resumes to PDF
- SQL-based database for storing user data and resumes

## Upcoming Features
- Further features will be added, including the ability to edit user details and implement more resume customization options.
- Add AI future to help user to write text.

## Database
This project uses SQL (via Entity Framework) for managing user and resume data. It includes the following:
- User data (name, email, password)
- Resume data (title, work experience, education, skills, languages)
